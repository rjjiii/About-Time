# About Time

Adds an About button to extensions in K-Meleon's Add-ons list. This is an unofficial build of Reality Ripple's extension "About Add-ons" that will install to older versions of K-Meleon without any special setup or modification. 

About Time is an unofficial build of About Add-ons from Reality Ripple Software. About Add-ons works fine on version 76 of K-Meleon. You can download it here:

Reality Ripple Software views this as an unsupported legacy release. It is distributed freely and as-is, but feel free to visit the K-Meleon forum if you have questions or issues:

About Time will install on older versions of K-Meleon. Some older versions of K-Meleon parsed the install.rdf differently. About Time supports K-Meleon 74.x, K-Meleon 74.x.g, K-Meleon 75.x, K-Meleon 76.x, and K-Meleon 76.x.g. If you need to transport XUL-based extensions from an older version of K-Meleon, this extension is for you.

To examine the source code, extract the .xpi file with any archiver like 7-zip or Winzip. To recompile the extension, add the top-level directory to a .zip archive and replace the ".zip" extension with ".xpi" instead.
